#AuthApp

AuthApp is a simple authentication app built purely in the backend using Express.js and Node.js. The app uses the bcrypt library to hash passwords and contains middlewares to ensure proper authentication.
Installation

To install AuthApp, follow these steps:

    Clone the repository or download the source code.
    Install Node.js and NPM (if not already installed).
    Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
    Run npm install to install all dependencies.
    Set up a MongoDB database and configure the connection URL in the .env file.

#Usage

AuthApp provides a simple API to register and authenticate users. The API endpoints are as follows:

    POST /api/users/register - Register a new user. Expects the following request body:

    json

{
  "username": "example",
  "password": "password123"
}

POST /api/users/login - Authenticate a user. Expects the following request body:

json

    {
      "username": "example",
      "password": "password123"
    }

    On successful authentication, a JSON Web Token (JWT) is returned in the response header (Authorization).

    GET /api/users/me - Get the details of the authenticated user. Requires a valid JWT in the Authorization header.

    POST /api/users/logout - Log out the authenticated user. Requires a valid JWT in the Authorization header.

Security

AuthApp takes security seriously and uses industry-standard techniques to ensure proper authentication. Passwords are hashed using the bcrypt library, and JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) are used to authenticate users. The app also contains middlewares to ensure proper authentication and authorization.
